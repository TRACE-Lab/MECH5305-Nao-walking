# MECH5315-Nao-walking
## Instruction on how to run this code
1. for Windows user, you have to run `compile_cpp.m` first, then run `Nao_main.m`. Note that you only need to run `compile_cpp.m` ONCE.
2. for Ubuntu and Mac user, you can start the simulation directly by running `Nao_main.m`.

## Folder notes
1. the folder `gen` contains the compiled cpp code which can run on `MATLAB`.
2. the folder `Optimization` contains the code to generate the optimal Bezier curve coefficient. Note: you do not need to worry about this folder if you only want to know about the system dynamics and control strategies.
